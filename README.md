# govim
A minimalist, Vim-inspired terminal playground written in Go. Navigate a `█` cursor with arrow keys and write characters on a virtual canvas—all in the terminal.

## What is govim?
`govim` is a simple, Go-powered experiment that echoes Vim’s keyboard-driven soul. Use arrow keys to move the `█` cursor across an 80x24 grid, and type to leave characters behind. It’s not a full editor—just a terminal toy for those who love raw, text-based control.

Imagine it as a canvas where you wield a block cursor, crafting your masterpiece one keystroke at a time.

## Features
- **Vim-like Navigation**: Move the `█` cursor with arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- **Character Writing**: Type any key to stamp that character at the cursor’s position.
- **Persistent Canvas**: Your creations stay put as you roam the grid.
- **Exit with Esc**: Hit `Esc` to quit and clear the slate.
